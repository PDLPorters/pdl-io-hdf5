PDL::IO::HDF5

From The Man Pages:
-------------------

NAME

     PDL::IO::HDF5 - PDL Interface to the HDF5 Data Format.

DESCRIPTION

     This package provides an object-oriented interface for the
     PDL package to the HDF5 data-format. Information on the
     HDF5 Format can be found at the HDF Group's web site at
     http://www.hdfgroup.org/ .

     LIMITATIONS
 
     Currently this interface only provides a subset of the total
     HDF5 library's capability.

    o Only HDF5 Simple datatypes are supported. No HDF5 Compound
      datatypes are supported since PDL doesn't support them.

    o Only HDF5 Simple dataspaces are supported.


Also Included:
--------------

An experimental module for interactive viewing of HDF5 files
using perl/Tk is also included. The file tkviewtest is a short
demo of this capability.


The following are required for installation:
--------------------------------------------

-- PDL v2.004

-- HDF5 version 1.2.0 or greater


Installation:
------------

Installation should be the normal:

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test

(as root)
make install


Acknowledgements
----------------

The idea for this module is based on the code of Doug Hunt's PDL::netCDF module.
