Release Notes for PDL-IO-HDF5 0.65_02 --------------------------

General Notes:

 * Another quick CPAN developers release

   - It is a snapshot of the current git development tree
     and everything may not work correctly or have complete
     documentation.

   - These release notes may not be fully complete.  Please
     see Changes (from the git log) for full details.

   - All tests may not pass, especially ones corresponding
     to issues in Known_problems.
   
   - Manual build/install is recommended although the
     cpan shell may be used by specifying the distribution
     path rather than just the module name, e.g.:

       cpan> get  CHM/PDL-IO-HDF5-0.65_02.tar.gz
       cpan> make CHM/PDL-IO-HDF5-0.65_02.tar.gz
       cpan> test CHM/PDL-IO-HDF5-0.65_02.tar.gz
       cpan> look CHM/PDL-IO-HDF5-0.65_02.tar.gz
